    <h1>The Best Movies According to Tom </h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Fight Club</h3>

    <p>Fight club is my favorite movie ever. Love the 90s vibe and the acting and story is so great, I have watched it
        many times and will continue to do so. </p>

    <h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>

    <p>I'm a big fan of the whole dystopian future setting. The story is great, Ryan Gosling plays the character very
        well.</p>

    <h3>The Revenant</h3>

    <p>The Revenant is a true master piece in my opinion.The cinematography is breathtaking, Tom Hardy and leonardo
        dicaprio are both excellent. </p>
